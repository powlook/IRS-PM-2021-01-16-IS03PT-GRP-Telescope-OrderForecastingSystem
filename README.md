#### THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

Besides their own brands, the company currently also handles over 200 brands and 16,000 products. Procurement of stocks are usually done monthly. Currently, forecasting of sales order are done monthly using Excel. This is not only time-consuming with the number of products but the forecasted accuracy is also far from ideal. The company is looking at ways where they can better forecast the sales. This is where we come in.

#### OUR PROPOSAL

We will create a Web Application which will:
   1. Forecast Orders per Product SKU (which will help with stock procurement)
      We will develop several models from general rolling moving average to statistical timeseries to deep learning models utilising LSTM techniques. We will select the best model in performance comparison
   2. Besides forecasting, the application will also do a Marketing Basket Analysis to identify products to recommend from those    
      already purchase. This may help the sales department to better plan their marketing campaign
