#### THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

Besides their own brands, the company currently also handles over 200 brands and 16,000 products. Procurement of stocks are usually done monthly. Currently, forecasting of sales order are done monthly using Excel. This is not only time-consuming with the number of products but the forecasted accuracy is also far from ideal. The company is looking at ways where they can better forecast the sales. This is where we come in.

#### OUR PROPOSAL

1. The system will be a complete pipeline from ingesting raw data from the database and writing back processed data back to the DB. The web application will be able to draw from the processed database to display and to decide.
2. To develop several forecasting models and select the best for the company to use for their application. The recommended model will be selected based on the lowest Maximum Absolute Error (MaxE) and the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
3. To extract insights from the historical transaction data to provide recommendations for products bundling during marketing promotions and making post sales recommendations to previous customers. We will make use of associative mining techniques to accomplish this objective.
